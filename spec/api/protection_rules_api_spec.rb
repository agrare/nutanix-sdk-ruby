  # unit tests for protection_rules_query_entities_get
  # Get a list of entities along with their protection status.
  # This API fetches what could be the protection status of the entity given a set of parameters. The entities to return are based on the category name and value pair which is passed as an input to the API. The recovery point objective values and some other parameters passed, also as query params, help to determine if there are any errors associated with it which are returned in the response. 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :categories Category name, value separated by &#39;:&#39;. Example: &#39;dept:eng&#39;. 
  # @option opts [Array<Integer>] :recovery_point_objective_seconds Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in seconds. This will be used to determine if the VM can be protected with the given RPO values. 
  # @option opts [Boolean] :has_intra_pc_dr_config Whether the Protection Rule has the intra PC DR policy configured. 
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :cluster_uuid_list List of PE cluster UUIDs for which the entities that belong to them are either fetched or ignored based on the value set for the should_exclude_cluster_uuid_list parameter. If no value is given then all the PE cluster UUIDs are looked at. 
  # @option opts [Boolean] :should_exclude_cluster_uuid_list Controls whether the cluster_uuid_list is an inclusion list or an exclusion list. If set to False, then the only the entities that are present on the clusters from the cluster_uuid_list are fetched. If set to True, then only the entities that are present on the clusters other than the ones from the cluster_uuid_list are fetched. 
  # @option opts [String] :protection_rule_uuid Protection rule UUID for which the query is being invoked. If protection rule isn&#39;t created yet then this field will be empty. 
  # @option opts [String] :protection_status_filter Filter value which dictates whether to show all entities, irrespective of their protection status, or entities for which there is protection failure, i.e., aren&#39;t protected at all. 
  # @option opts [String] :entity_type The entity type to be queried. Set to VM by default. 
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset Offset from the start of the entity list.
  # @option opts [Integer] :length The number of records to retrieve relative to the offset.
  # @return [QueryEntitiesResponse]

The API triggers the protection rule processing and returns.
